// Strings:
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Look up the following string methods!

// Using charAt(), print the letter i in Sabrina

// Define Unicode in a comment, and get the Unicode using charCodeAt() of the third character in Teddy

// Using fromCharCode() - make it readable for us :). You'll see!

// Take your first and last name and concat()

// Create a string and make it return true using startsWith()

// Now use any variable with endsWith() and return false

// Finish the following sentence. Use includes() and return true.

// Loops:
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Ken has a headache today and he said the room has been spinning like crazy. Make Ken's room spin 10 times using FOR LOOP. Make him print a sentence.

// Harry said that was so mean of Teo to do Ken dirty like that. Make Teo's vision spin 20 times FOR LOOP.

// But wait! Lisa said, while Teo is spinning 20 times. Let's make him say "I'm sorry". Print I'm sorry 20 times using a WHILE loop.

// For the next three, look for the syntax of FOR IN and FOR OF loop. Very easy to understand syntax, and very clean :) 

// To The Left! To The Left! Everything I want in the console to the left. Print thing1, thing2, thing 3 using (FOR IN LOOP)
const whateverQueenBeySaid = {

  // Using (FOR IN LOOP), print the indexes of the array.
  const lana = ['l', 'a', 'n', 'a']
  
  // USE (FOR OF LOOP)!
  const tia = ['teo', 'the', 'syntax', 'of', 'this', 'is', 'cleaner']
  
  // Look into forEach() loop, it accepts a callback aka a function inside a function. 
  // Swathi said don't forget each person. No person left behind! Use forEach() to iterate over the array perscholas. Inside the function, create a variable with the string "PS". Print their name in the console concatenated with the variable. 
  const perscholas = ['Amira', 'Arely', 'Jonathan']

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Arrays:

// length

/* You've been tasked to do this week's grocery shopping. As you arrive at Times Supermarket, Raphael pings you to get a bottle of Hendricks gin. Add this to the existing shoppingList and console.log it.*/

  "fruit loops cereal"

//3.  Use the force, or in this case the reverse method to help Yoda make some sense with his motivational talk to the young Jedi interns.*/

//5. Help Nike sell more overpriced sneakers by changing their slogan from an array into a string. Convert the shoe array and assign it to a variable named `shoeString`. Console.log this new variable.

var shoe = ["just", "do", "it"];

// ===== SPREAD OPERATOR ===== 

// Create a variable and assign a value of a copied array using the spread operator

// Create two arrays with any elements and connect both of them using the spread operator. Save the connected arrays into a new variable.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Functions:
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// Don't forget to CALL your functions

//1. Write a function maxOfTwoNumbers that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. Use the if-then-else construct available in Javascript. Do some googling to figure this out if you forget how conditionals work.

//2. Write a function maxOfThree that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them.

//3. Write a function isCharacterAVowel that takes a character (i.e. a string of length 1) and returns true if it is a vowel, false otherwise

//4. Write a function charCount that takes a string and returns the length of the string.

//5. Write a function vowelCount that takes a String and returns the number of vowels in the String. Add a check for the string to be of 10 or less characters.
